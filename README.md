#Map My Brewery


##BEERS, BEERS AND MORE BEERS!...

###About
  If the header of this README file hasn't gotten your full attention well then let me help you out a little more!
  
  If you ever find yourself drinking at the same bar, drinking the same beer you had for the last year, the same beer that doesn't even
quench your thurst and satifaction anymore and you find yourself drinking it for reasons like "Hey, I know I like it" or "There's nothing 
else that I like"... **LAME!** 

  You need a change in your selection. With new breweries popping up like Pop-Rocks in water there's no good reason not to try the specialty crafted beers from local breweries that might just be around the corner from where you are standing. Enough with the boring robotic beer choices. You need something new, somthing exciting, that new bold flavored beer that would get all your friends jealous because their mouths aren't as happy. Use this app and your find more then just beer, you'll find satisfaction!


###User Interface
####Home Screen
  From the start you will be greeted by a home screen that calls for the Zip Code of the area that you want to search.

####Map/Result Page
  After entering the zip code you will be taken to the view of the map and hopefully the rendered markers of the breweries in that area.

  If a list of breweries have been found it will be listed on the right side of the screen under "Look at these place" header. You can click on the names of the breweries an information window will open at the marker location of that bar. The info window will have clickable links to there website and phone number. Before you enter another zip code you can save that bar onto your favs list by clicking on the 'interested' button. 
  
###Mobile View
This is what the app looks like in the view of a iPhone:

###Technologies
The technologies used to render information from both BreweryDB API and Google Maps API were:
* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript - 
* Express.js

####Libraries:
* jQuery

Javascript was used along with jQuery to allow both Google Map API and BreweryDB API to communicate. Express.js was utilized to set up a proxy server to allow access to BreweryDB database. The website is responsive to desktops, tablets and smartphones.
